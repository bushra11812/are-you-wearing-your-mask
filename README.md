# Are you wearing your mask?

In this project we aim to understand how people's mask usage habits change in Istanbul, during the Covid-19 outbreak. As of 15th of March, the project is still under development and we aim to complete it before the patient count hits 100. 

## The why

  - This data can be used to track public awareness and how different social event affect mask usage.
  - It is a challenging Computer Vision problem
  - We are advised to distance ourselves from the outside world and schools are cancelled for at least 3 weeks so we have nothing to do.


## The how
  - Find live streams of municipality street cams
  - Read from the stream using OpenCV
  - Detect and count people passing by who are facing the camera
  - Extract faces
  - Classify faces as either "wearing a mask" or "not wearing a mask"
  - Play around with the data, mark important events, turning points and relate them to real world events
